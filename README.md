Pet-project: Weather. 

The simplest app that shows you the weather based on your current location. 
The main screen of the app displays your location, namely the city, and the weather temperature directly. 

To get weather data by "latitude and longitude" I took the API from an open source project - open-meteo.com;
I used CLLocation to get latitude and longitude parameters, which I substituted further into the open-meteo API.
